# 1. Simulate Daily Demand and Analyze Results
# Write a function that simulates the daily demand for the product over the next n days using a Poisson distribution.

# Steps:

# Assume the average daily demand (Î») is 20 units.
# Use numpy to generate Poisson-distributed daily demand for n days.
# Analyze the Results:

# Calculate and print the following statistics from the simulation results:
# Mean (average) daily demand
# Standard deviation
# 5th percentile (to understand the lower bound in a worst-case scenario)
# 95th percentile (to understand the upper bound in a best-case scenario)
# Interpret the results in the context of inventory management.
